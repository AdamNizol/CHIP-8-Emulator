See INSTRUCTIONS.md for how to run tests and emulator.

To develop the games while our emulator is being built, we are using this emulator: https://github.com/massung/CHIP-8  
The games are created in Assembly Language, which is described here how it translates to the Chip8 opcodes: http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#4xkk
